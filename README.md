# 🏥 Hospital Intelligence Dashboard  
_A comprehensive Power BI project for hospital performance analysis_

---

## 🩺 Brief Summary

Designed and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to provide actionable insights into hospital operations across patients, doctors, staff, and financial performance metrics.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project presents a data-driven solution to monitor and analyze key operational metrics in a hospital environment. Using structured data modeling and advanced DAX calculations in Power BI, it enables stakeholders to make informed decisions based on real-time insights.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Hospitals generate massive data across various departments — patients, medical staff, finance, beds, and medicine sales — but often lack the infrastructure to consolidate this information for actionable analysis. This project solves the problem by creating a centralized and dynamic dashboard to track real-time hospital KPIs.

- Patient records  
- Doctor and staff details  
- Financial transactions and billing  
- Hospital beds and room occupancy  
- Medicine inventory and sales  

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technology

- **SQL** – Data cleaning, transformation, joining  
- **Power BI** – Dashboard development, data modeling, visualizations  
- **DAX** – Measures and calculated columns  
- **Excel** – Data profiling and preliminary checks  

---

## ⚙️ Methods

- Cleaned 15+ unstructured datasets by removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and correcting data types in SQL  
- Reduced dataset complexity by joining and transforming into **6 essential analysis tables**  
- Created robust Power BI data model with proper relationships and hierarchies  
- Developed **25+ DAX measures** and **15+ calculated columns** to support advanced analytics  
- Built **6 fully interactive dashboards** to visualize and monitor hospital KPIs  

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Identified top-performing doctors by revenue contribution and commission earned  
- Tracked patient inflow/outflow and categorized by age and admission status  
- Analyzed total staff costs, average salary, and staff distribution by roles  
- Monitored billing trends and average fees over time  
- Tracked medicine stock and sales quantity by quarter
